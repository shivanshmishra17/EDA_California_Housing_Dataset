# EDA_California_Housing_Dataset
A Descriptive Data Analysis of California Housing Dataset.
The California Housing Dataset is based on data from the 1990 census.The dataset contains **10 features** that have **20,640 observations**. Each observation is a single block group within California.

Block groups are the smallest geographical units for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people). There are 20,640 block groups in the project dataset.

All of the features are numeric except `ocean_proximity` which is of categorical type.

Out of 9 Numeric variables, three are continuous (`longitude`, `latitude`, and `median_income`) and six are discrete (`housing_median_age`, `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, `households`, and `median_house_value`).

`longitude` and `latitude` denote how far west and north the block is respectively. 

`housing_median_age`, `median_income`, and `median_house_value` are the median ages (years), incomes (10,000 USD), and housing price estimates (USD) for each block. 

`total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, and `households` reflect the total number of rooms, bedrooms, people, and housing units in each block.

**The performed data analysis and problems answered in this dataset were part of a Mandatory Project assigned by Odin School.**
